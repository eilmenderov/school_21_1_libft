Introduction

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions.
This project gives you the opportunity to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them.
This library will help you for all your future C projects. Through this project, we also give you the
opportunity to expand the list of functions with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.

test libft:

git clone https://github.com/Avchar/school_21_1_libft.git && cd school_21_1_libft/lib-unit-test && make && ./run_test
